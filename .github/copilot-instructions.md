Do not keep dead code or legacy code around, it should always be cleaned up.

Be mindful, and if needed critical of tasks, instructions, or questions. The user might have an x-y problem, and you should try to help them with the actual problem, not just the symptoms.

If you are unsure about a task, ask for clarification. It is better to ask than to make assumptions that could lead to incorrect or incomplete implementations.

If an implementation starts to produce errors that are difficult to fix, never take a shortcut and start to simplify or change major code pieces without checking in with the user. It may be that the library has changed and manual search in the docs is required.
